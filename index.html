          Let's say it's the beginning of the semester year and you see your calculus course syllabus as follows:
          <div class = "grades">
            Grades:<br>
            Course grades are determined from your overall total score as follows:<br><br>
            <li>Homework: 40%</li>
            <li>Quizzes: 20%</li>
            <li>Final: 40%</li>
            <br>
            There will be 10 homeworks.
            <br>
            There will be 10 quizzes.
            <br>
            There will be 1 final exam.
            <br><br>
            Cutoffs:<br>
            <li class = second_list>A+ 97%</li>
            <li class = second_list>A 93%</li>
            <li class = second_list>A- 90%</li>
            <li class = second_list>B+ 87%</li>
            <li class = second_list>B 83%</li>
            <li class = second_list>B- 80%</li>
            <li class = second_list>C+ 77%</li>
            <li class = second_list>C 73%</li>
            <li class = second_list>C- 70%</li>
            <li class = second_list>D+ 67%</li>
            <li class = second_list>D 63%</li>
            <li class = second_list>D- 60%</li>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class = "second_step">
          Go ahead and enter
          <li class = second_list>Homework</li>
          <li class = second_list>Quizzes</li>
          <li class = second_list>Final</li>
          into the categories.

          <div class = image>
            <img src = "g2.PNG">
          </div>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
          Next select the first category homework by clicking on its button.
          <div class = image_2>
            <img src = "g3.PNG">
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class = third_step>
          When you click a particular category, the "Select a category" element will automatically refer you to 
          the category you picked. Let us first click homework and enter the corresponding values for the first 3 inputs.<br><br>
          <li class = second_list>We know the category weight is 40.</li>
          <li class = second_list> Number of assessments is 10. </li>
          <li class = second_list>Max points on each assessment can be assumed to be 100 if it's unknown.</li><br>
          <div class = image_3>
            <img src = "g4.PNG">
          </div>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br>
          Enter the first 3 values. You should see the numbers appear in the information below.
          Do the same for the other categories.
        </div>
        <div class = fourth_step>
          Once the top 3 values are entered for each category, 
          <div class = image_4>
            <img src = "g5.PNG">
          </div>
          <br>you may click calculate.
          <br><br>
          You will be prompted "Would you like to use the default cut offs?" If your cut offs match the one in this example, 
          you can click ok. Otherwise, click cancel and go ahead and enter your own cut offs.
          <div class = image_5>
            <img src = "g6.PNG">
          </div>
          <br>
          <div class = image_6>
            <img src = "g7.PNG">
          </div>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
          After clicking calculate, notice the "Predict average %" element.
          <br>This allows you to make predictions about your average grade <br>on each category in which you still have work yet to be completed.
        </div>

        <div class = "fifth_step">
          <div class = image_7>
            <img src = "g9.PNG">
          </div>
          For example, if we have all categories except homework pulled <br>to 0% and have homework at 100%, this demonstrates 
          the <br>scenario in which for the ungraded coursework (in this case <br>nothing is graded yet) we achieve an average of 
          0% on<br> everything and full marks on hw. The results at the "grade <br>thermometer" show that we would achieve a 40%.
          This makes <br>sense because homework is weighted 40% of the total grade <br>and we have yet to input any assignments.<br><br>
            <div class = image_8>
              <img src = "g8.PNG">
            </div>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            Suppose we want to enter some scores after we completed some homework and quiz assessments. Select the category (under CATEGORIES) in which you would like to input score(s). <br><br>
            <div class = image_9>
              <img src = "g10.PNG">
            </div> 
            <br><br>When you have input the scores <br>you have earned so far,
            click <br>calculate again to evaluate your <br>current status.
            <br><br><br><br>
            <div class = image_10>
              <img src = "g5.PNG">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class = "sixth_step">
          Suppose we are nearing the end of the course and recently <br> put in our last few homework and quiz scores. Only the <br>final is yet to be done.<br><br>
          <div class = image_12>
            <img src = g12.png>
          </div>
          <div class = image_11>
            <img src = "g11.PNG">
          </div>
          <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
          The left scale of the "grade thermometer" is the weighted <br>average of the remaining course categories which is determined <br>by your predictions using the sliders. 
          <br><br>
          MIN and MAX display the lowest possible and highest possible <br>grade you could end up with. Note that you may end up with <br>different values depending on what you entered for previous <br>homework and quiz scores.

          <br><br>The difference in this case between MIN and MAX is 40% because the final is worth 40% of the grade. The tag attached
          to the right scale of the "grade thermometer" will be your final grade if the predictions based on the sliders are accurate.

          You can delete individual
          <li class = second_list>categories</li>
          <li class = second_list>work completed so far</li>
          <li class = second_list>grade cut offs</li>
